# HairStyle_Sprint2
Something before sprint3

Trello： https://trello.com/b/KEP6SeFv/hair-style-simulation1

IN Sprint2, we created two folders due to different division of labor. The grabcutios-master is the algorithm we implemented to differentiate people's face from hair. The HairStyle_Sprint2_UI is the initial user interface we build.

The next step is to combine those two parts together, and add some hairstyles into the app, etc.
